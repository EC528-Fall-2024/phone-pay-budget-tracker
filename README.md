# Mobile Payment Budget Tracker App

## 1. Vision and Goal
The goal of the project is to create a scalable cloud-native budget-tracking mobile app that integrates with popular mobile payment systems such as Gpay, Apple Pay, etc. providing users with enhanced visuals and analysis of their spending habits. 

## 2. User Cases
This app will be used by anyone who does a lot of online shopping on their phone, doesn't like to carry physical cards around, or generally feels as if they need a centralized place to track their online purchases and needs help creating good financial habits.

1. **John**
   - _Description_: John does not like to carry his bulky wallet around. It barely fits in his pocket with how many cards he has and he is worried that it may be a prime target for a thief.
   - _Needs_: John needs one app to track his mobile payments throughout his 15 different cards without having to check the app of each individual bank

2. **Hannah**
   - _Description_: Hannah has very bad spending habits. It is too easy to whip out her phone at every shop and pay with her phone without looking at how much she has already spent because it is too difficult to keep track of her money.
